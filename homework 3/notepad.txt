<html>
<body>

2) Element consists of a start tag and end tag 
 In element consists of <h1> this is element </h1>
                        <p> this is element </p>

there are empty elements that means if we dont have any content should be a tag <br>

for example

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1> this is example for elemet </h1>
<p> element </p>

</body>
</html>

3) an attribute


Tags can also have attributes, which are extra bits of information. Attributes appear inside the opening tag and their values sit inside quotation marks. They look something like <tag attribute="value">Margarine</tag>. We will come across tags with attributes later

. An HTML attribute is an associated property of an HTML element and used to extend the capability of an HTML element.

2. HTML attributes (usually) have values and are written after a "=" after the name of the attribute.

3. Attribute value pair is placed before the last ">" of an HTML start tag.

parent element and child element
The element>element selector is used to select elements with a specific parent.

 * Elements that are not directly a child of the specified parent, are not selected.


 versions of html 4 AND html 5

 December 18, 1997
HTML 4.0[18] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers three variations:
Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden
Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed
Frameset, in which mostly only frame related elements are allowed.
Initially code-named "Cougar",[17] HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and attributes, but at the same time sought to phase out Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as deprecated in favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to ISO 8879 – SGML.[19]
April 24, 1998
HTML 4.0[20] was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number.
December 24, 1999
HTML 4.01[21] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and its last errata were published on May 12, 2001.
May 2000
ISO/IEC 15445:2000[22][23] ("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was published as an ISO/IEC international standard. In the ISO this standard falls in the domain of the ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34 (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 – Document description and processing languages).[22]
After HTML 4.01, there was no new version of HTML for many years as development of the parallel, XML-based language XHTML occupied the W3C's HTML Working Group through the early and mid-2000s.
October 28, 2014
HTML5[24] was published as a W3C Recommendation.[25]

6(It is possible to design websites
TML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is used to create web pages. Site authors use HTML to format text as titles and headings, to arrange graphics on a webpage, to link to different pages within a website, and to link to different websites.
